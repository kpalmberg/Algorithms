# Algorithms
This repo contains a variety of computer science algorithms.

Many algorithms will be based off the pseudocode in "Introduction to Algorithms" (MIT Press).
Since the algorithms in this book are all in pseudocode, I will be implementing them
in a variety of programming languages, but probably focusing mostly on the C programming language.

There will be other algorithms outside of the scope of this text included in this repo as well.
