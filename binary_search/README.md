This is a small program implementing Binary Search in the Go programming language.
Binary search takes a sorted array & determines if a specified element exists within it.
It runs in O(Log(n)) time complexity as opposed to O(n) is linear search algorithm.
This makes it a far more efficient algorithm comparing to linear search when the array
being searched is already in sorted order.
